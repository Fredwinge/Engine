# Engine

This is a project i've been working on during my free time to further my DirectX knowledge, following no particular tutorial
but just taking in ideas from wherever and stitching them together haphazardly. <br>

I use the DirectXTex library for loading textures currently, it can be found here: <br>

If you want to look at more recent developments check out the unstable branch, master tends to fall behind a bit.
