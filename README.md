This is a project i've been working on during my free time to further my DirectX knowledge, most of the stuff so far 
is ripped from ChiliTomatoNoodle's 3D DirectX Programming series with some alterations. <br>

So far i've followed the content up until Episode 26 (texture mapping) as well as using episode 48 (DirectXTex) individually
as a guide for implementing the DirectXTex library as i decided to break away from the tutorials by not using GDI+ at this point. <br>
The DirectXTex library can be found here: <br>

If you want to look at more recent developments check out the unstable branch, master tends to fall behind a bit.
